# Task-7
# ðŸ§  Task 07 â€“ Ethical Implications of LLM Decision Making

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The goal of Task 07 was to translate my earlier LLM-based analysis (from Task 05 and Task 06) into a **stakeholder-facing decision report**. This required not only summarizing findings but also incorporating **tiered recommendations, ethical/legal analysis, data provenance, uncertainty, and robustness checks**.

## ðŸ“‹ Stakeholder Report
This report is written for the **Head Coach and Athletic Director of Syracuse Womenâ€™s Lacrosse**, with the purpose of guiding training and strategic decision-making for the upcoming season.

### Key Findings
- Syracuse played **22 games** with a **16â€“6 record**.
- Lost **3 games in overtime (0â€“3 OT record)**.
- Most defensive breakdowns occurred in **Q4 (55 goals allowed)**.
- Offense averaged **15.23 goals/game** â€“ strong relative to peers.
- Syracuse committed fewer **shot clock violations (6)** than opponents (13).

### Tiered Recommendations
- **Low Risk (Operational):**
  - Emphasize defensive drills focused on Q4.
  - Review substitution and timeout strategies for late-game scenarios.
- **Medium Risk (Investigatory):**
  - Analyze conditioning and endurance during overtime.
  - Pilot alternative OT strategies in scrimmages.
- **High Risk:**
  - No personnel or scholarship changes recommended.

### Ethical, Fairness & Legal Considerations
- **Data provenance:** Official Syracuse Athletics season stats (2024).  
- **Scope:** Team-level data only; no player-level or demographic breakdown.  
- **Bias/Fairness:** Subgroup analysis (e.g., by position) not possible with current data.  
- **Uncertainty:** No confidence intervals due to data limits; findings are descriptive.  
- **Transparency:** All LLM prompts, transcripts, and edits are logged in the repo.
